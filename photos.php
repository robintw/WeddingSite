        <p>Please take lots of photos during our wedding!<p>
        <p>Although we will have a nominated wedding photographer, we have found in the past that some of the best
        photos of weddings are often taken by the guests. After the wedding we will arrange an upload function on this page, so that you can send the best of your photos to us.</p>
